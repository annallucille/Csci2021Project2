// Uses the two global variables (ports) BATT_VOLTAGE_PORT and
// BATT_STATUS_PORT to set the fields of the parameter 'batt'.  If
// BATT_VOLTAGE_PORT is negative, then battery has been wired wrong;
// no fields of 'batt' are changed and 1 is returned to indicate an
// error.  Otherwise, sets fields of batt based on reading the voltage
// value and converting to percent using the provided formula. Returns
// 0 on a successful execution with no errors. This function DOES NOT
// modify any global variables but may access global variables.
//
// CONSTRAINT: Avoids the use of the division operation as much as
// possible. Makes use of shift operations in place of division where
// possible.
//
// CONSTRAINT: Uses only integer operations. No floating point
// operations are used as the target machine does not have a FPU.
// 
// CONSTRAINT: Limit the complexity of code as much as possible. Do
// not use deeply nested conditional structures. Seek to make the code
// as short, and simple as possible.

// Alters the bits of integer pointed to by 'display' to reflect the
// data in struct param 'batt'.  Does not assume any specific bit
// pattern stored at 'display' and completely resets all bits in it on
// successfully completing.  Selects either to show Volts (mode=1) or
// Percent (mode=2). If Volts are displayed, only displays 3 digits
// rounding the lowest digit up or down appropriate to the last digit.
// Calculates each digit to display changes bits at 'display' to show
// the volts/percent according to the pattern for each digit. Modifies
// additional bits to show a decimal place for volts and a 'V' or '%'
// indicator appropriate to the mode. In both modes, places bars in
// the level display as indicated by percentage cutoffs in provided
// diagrams. This function DOES NOT modify any global variables but
// may access global variables. Always returns 0.

// voltage sensor then set the display. Checks these functions and if
// they indicate an error, does NOT change the display.  If functions
// succeed, modifies BATT_DISPLAY_PORT to show current battery level.
